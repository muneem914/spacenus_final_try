# Welcome! 
## Spacenus Polygon Mapper !
A frontend task to be completed !
### Technology Used: 
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Redux-toolkit
- tailwindcss
- NPM packages
    - react-icons
    - react-leaflet, leaflet
    - react-leaflet-draw, leaflet-draw
    - turf
### Project Details: 
- Integrated react leaflet map where users can draw polygons
- Configured redux toolkit for state management
- User can save polygon and delete polygon. (edit/delete functionality from drawing tool is not working)
- User can view, delete, edit polyogn fill/boundary color, edit label name on a separate tab using color picker
- Placed marker with polygons area and center as tooltip on hover, at polygons center
- Polygon validation: failed to do this
- After drawing polygons, user can export/download them as a polygon.json
- polygon.json file can be imported again with all coordinates and polygons back to redux state as well as to the map view.
- When user will visit for the first time, his/her location will be asked, after accesing to users location, his/her latitude and longitude will be saved to local storge, so each time when user enter into the website, geolocation will be there for him/her.
- So many polygons ? no worries. Advanced search and filter functions are there to sort polygons according to IDs or labels. (both map view or list polygon page, it will work)
